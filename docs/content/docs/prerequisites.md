# Prerequisites

To start using `ash` please make sure to install and configure the following:

* Tools installed to run Linux containers, such as [Finch](https://github.com/runfinch/finch), [Rancher Desktop](https://rancherdesktop.io/), [Podman Desktop](https://podman-desktop.io/), or [Docker Desktop](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/).
  * This can be any CLI + container engine combination; there is nothing in ASH that requires a specific container runtime.
  * If on Windows, you will also likely need Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) installed as a prerequisite for the listed container engine tools. Please see the specific instructions for the tool of choice regarding Windows-specific prerequisites.
