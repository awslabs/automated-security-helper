## Overview

ASH (Automated Security Helper) is a security scanning tool designed to help you identify potential security issues in your code, infrastructure, and IAM configurations as early as possible in your development process.

- ASH is not a replacement for human review or team/customer security standards
- It leverages lightweight, open-source tools for flexibility and portability
- ASH v3 has been completely rewritten in Python with significant improvements to usability and functionality

## Key Features in ASH v3

- **Python-based CLI**: ASH now has a Python-based CLI entrypoint while maintaining backward compatibility with the shell script entrypoint
- **Multiple Execution Modes**: Run ASH in `local`, `container`, or `precommit` mode depending on your needs
- **Enhanced Configuration**: Support for YAML/JSON configuration files with overrides via CLI parameters
- **Improved Reporting**: Multiple report formats including JSON, Markdown, HTML, and CSV
- **Scanner Validation System**: Comprehensive validation ensures all expected scanners are registered, enabled, queued, executed, and included in results
- **Pluggable Architecture**: Extend ASH with custom plugins, scanners, and reporters
- **Unified Output Format**: Standardized output format that can be exported to multiple formats (SARIF, JSON, HTML, Markdown, CSV)
- **UV Package Management**: ASH now uses UV for faster dependency resolution and tool isolation
- **Comprehensive Testing**: Extensive integration test suite validates UV migration functionality across platforms

## Built-In Scanners

ASH v3 integrates multiple open-source security tools as scanners. Tools like Bandit, Checkov, and Semgrep are managed via UV's tool isolation system, which automatically installs and runs them in isolated environments without affecting your project dependencies:

- **Configuration files**: `.ash/ash.yaml` or custom config paths
- **Environment variables**: `ASH_DEFAULT_SEVERITY_LEVEL`, `ASH_OFFLINE`, etc.
- **CLI parameters**: Severity thresholds, custom output directories

For detailed information about streaming capabilities and advanced usage, see the [MCP Streaming Guide](docs/content/tutorials/mcp-streaming-guide.md).


## Configuration

ASH v3 uses a YAML configuration file (`.ash/ash.yaml`) with support for JSON Schema validation:

```yaml
# yaml-language-server: $schema=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/awslabs/automated-security-helper/refs/heads/main/automated_security_helper/schemas/AshConfig.json
project_name: my-project
global_settings:
  severity_threshold: MEDIUM
  ignore_paths:
    - path: 'tests/test_data'
      reason: 'Test data only'
scanners:
  bandit:
    enabled: true
    options:
      confidence_level: high
reporters:
  markdown:
    enabled: true
    options:
      include_detailed_findings: true
```

## Using ASH with pre-commit

Add this to your `.pre-commit-config.yaml`:

```yaml
repos:
  - repo: https://github.com/awslabs/automated-security-helper
    rev: v3.0.0
    hooks:
      - id: ash-simple-scan
```

Run with:

```bash
pre-commit run ash-simple-scan --all-files
```

## Output Files

ASH v3 produces several output files in the `.ash/ash_output/` directory:

- `ash_aggregated_results.json`: Complete machine-readable results including validation checkpoints
- `reports/ash.summary.txt`: Human-readable text summary
- `reports/ash.summary.md`: Markdown summary for GitHub PRs and other platforms
- `reports/ash.html`: Interactive HTML report
- `reports/ash.csv`: CSV report for filtering and sorting findings

The `ash_aggregated_results.json` file includes comprehensive validation information that tracks scanner registration, enablement, execution, and result inclusion throughout the scan process. The Scanner Validation System can also generate detailed validation reports that provide comprehensive analysis of scanner states, validation checkpoints, dependency issues, and actionable recommendations for troubleshooting scan issues.

## FAQ

<details>
<summary>How do I run ASH on Windows?</summary>

ASH v3 can run directly on Windows in local mode with Python 3.10+. Simply install ASH using pip, pipx, or uvx and run with `--mode local`. For container mode, you'll need WSL2 and a container runtime like Docker Desktop, Rancher Desktop, or Podman Desktop.
</details>

<details>
<summary>How do I run ASH in CI/CD pipelines?</summary>

ASH can be run in container mode in any CI/CD environment that supports containers. See the [tutorials](docs/content/tutorials/running-ash-in-ci.md) for examples.
</details>

<details>
<summary>How do I exclude files from scanning?</summary>

ASH respects `.gitignore` files. You can also configure ignore paths in your `.ash/ash.yaml` configuration file.
</details>

<details>
<summary>How do I run ASH in an offline/air-gapped environment?</summary>

Build an offline image with `ash --mode container --offline --offline-semgrep-rulesets p/ci --no-run`, push to your private registry, then use `ash --mode container --offline --no-build` in your air-gapped environment.
</details>

<details>
<summary>I am trying to scan a CDK application, but ASH does not show CDK Nag scan results -- why is that?</summary>

ASH uses CDK Nag underneath to apply NagPack rules to *CloudFormation templates* via the `CfnInclude` CDK construct. This is purely a mechanism to ingest a bare CloudFormation template and apply CDK NagPacks to it; doing this against a template emitted by another CDK application causes a collision in the `CfnInclude` construct due to the presence of the `BootstrapVersion` parameter on the template added by CDK. For CDK applications, we recommend integrating CDK Nag directly in your CDK code. ASH will still apply other CloudFormation scanners (cfn-nag, checkov) against templates synthesized via CDK, but the CDK Nag scanner will not scan those templates.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Why is ASH trying to install tools automatically? Can I use my own tool installations?</summary>

ASH v3 uses UV's tool isolation system to automatically manage scanner dependencies like Bandit, Checkov, and Semgrep. This ensures consistent tool versions and avoids dependency conflicts. If you prefer to use your own tool installations:

1. **Pre-install tools**: Install tools manually using `uv tool install <tool>` or your preferred method
2. **Offline mode**: Set `ASH_OFFLINE=true` to skip automatic installations and use system-installed tools
3. **Fallback behavior**: ASH automatically falls back to system-installed tools if UV tool installation fails

The automatic installation uses sensible default version constraints to ensure compatibility:
- **Bandit**: `>=1.7.0` (enhanced SARIF support and security fixes)
- **Checkov**: `>=3.2.0,<4.0.0` (improved stability, avoiding potential breaking changes in 4.x)
- **Semgrep**: `>=1.125.0` (comprehensive rule support and performance improvements)

These constraints can be overridden through scanner configuration when needed.
</details>

<details>
<summary>ASH is failing with UV tool installation errors. How do I fix this?</summary>

If you're experiencing UV tool installation issues:

1. **Check UV installation**: Ensure UV is installed and available: `uv --version`
2. **Network connectivity**: UV tool installation requires internet access
3. **Use offline mode**: Set `ASH_OFFLINE=true` to skip downloads and use pre-installed tools
4. **Manual installation**: Pre-install tools manually:
   ```bash
   uv tool install bandit>=1.7.0
   uv tool install checkov>=3.2.0,<4.0.0
   uv tool install semgrep>=1.125.0
   ```
5. **Check logs**: Run ASH with `--verbose` to see detailed error messages including:
   - UV availability status
   - Tool installation attempts and retry logic
   - Version detection information
   - Fallback mechanism activation
6. **Fallback to system tools**: ASH will automatically try to use system-installed tools if UV installation fails
7. **Installation timeout**: Increase timeout in scanner configuration if needed:
   ```yaml
   scanners:
     checkov:
       options:
         install_timeout: 600  # 10 minutes
   ```
