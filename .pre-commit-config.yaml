          # Default behavior is to fail if any actionable findings are found.
          # We are working through resolution right now while still needing
          # to run this hook, so we are disabling the '--fail-on-findings' default
          # behavior temporarily to allow the hook to not be blocking while
          # still providing necessary visibility into findings state.

          # Default output-dir is `.ash/ash_output`, customize if preferred.

          # manual runs so results are retained independently.
