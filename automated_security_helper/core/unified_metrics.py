"""Unified metrics calculation for ASH scan results.

This module provides a centralized implementation for calculating and accessing scanner metrics
across all components of ASH. It serves as the single source of truth for scanner statistics,
ensuring consistency across all reports and displays.

The module defines the ScannerMetrics data structure and provides functions to generate
unified scanner metrics from the final aggregated SARIF data. These metrics include counts
for different severity levels, suppressed findings, actionable findings based on thresholds,
and scanner status information.

All components that need to display or process scanner statistics should use this module
to ensure consistency and avoid duplication of calculation logic.

Example usage:
    ```python
    from automated_security_helper.core.unified_metrics import get_unified_scanner_metrics

    # Get unified metrics for all scanners
    scanner_metrics = get_unified_scanner_metrics(asharp_model)

    # Access metrics for a specific scanner
    for metrics in scanner_metrics:
        if metrics.scanner_name == "bandit":
            print(f"Bandit found {metrics.actionable} actionable findings")
    ```
