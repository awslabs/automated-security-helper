# ASH "StarGrep" Rules

These are custom config rules compatible with both Semgrep and Opengrep that are applied alongside
the config rules already being applied for the scan.

Rule files must end in `.yaml`. Introduction of new rules to this directory applies by default to all ASH users, so reviewing changes to this directory are mandatory.
