# AWS WAF Regional Construct Library

This module is part of the [AWS Cloud Development Kit](https://github.com/aws/aws-cdk) project.

```python
import aws_cdk.aws_wafregional as wafregional
```

> The construct library for this service is in preview. Since it is not stable yet, it is distributed
> as a separate package so that you can pin its version independently of the rest of the CDK. See the package:

> <span class="package-reference">@aws-cdk/aws-wafregional-alpha</span>

<!--BEGIN CFNONLY DISCLAIMER-->

There are no hand-written ([L2](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/latest/guide/constructs.html#constructs_lib)) constructs for this service yet.
However, you can still use the automatically generated [L1](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/latest/guide/constructs.html#constructs_l1_using) constructs, and use this service exactly as you would using CloudFormation directly.

For more information on the resources and properties available for this service, see the [CloudFormation documentation for AWS::WAFRegional](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/AWS_WAFRegional.html).

            The bytes (typically a string that corresponds with ASCII characters) that you want AWS WAF to search for in web requests, the location in requests that you want AWS WAF to search, and other settings.

            :param field_to_match: The part of a web request that you want AWS WAF to inspect, such as a specific header or a query string.
            :param positional_constraint: Within the portion of a web request that you want to search (for example, in the query string, if any), specify where you want AWS WAF to search. Valid values include the following: *CONTAINS* The specified part of the web request must include the value of ``TargetString`` , but the location doesn't matter. *CONTAINS_WORD* The specified part of the web request must include the value of ``TargetString`` , and ``TargetString`` must contain only alphanumeric characters or underscore (A-Z, a-z, 0-9, or _). In addition, ``TargetString`` must be a word, which means one of the following: - ``TargetString`` exactly matches the value of the specified part of the web request, such as the value of a header. - ``TargetString`` is at the beginning of the specified part of the web request and is followed by a character other than an alphanumeric character or underscore (_), for example, ``BadBot;`` . - ``TargetString`` is at the end of the specified part of the web request and is preceded by a character other than an alphanumeric character or underscore (_), for example, ``;BadBot`` . - ``TargetString`` is in the middle of the specified part of the web request and is preceded and followed by characters other than alphanumeric characters or underscore (_), for example, ``-BadBot;`` . *EXACTLY* The value of the specified part of the web request must exactly match the value of ``TargetString`` . *STARTS_WITH* The value of ``TargetString`` must appear at the beginning of the specified part of the web request. *ENDS_WITH* The value of ``TargetString`` must appear at the end of the specified part of the web request.
            :param text_transformation: Text transformations eliminate some of the unusual formatting that attackers use in web requests in an effort to bypass AWS WAF . If you specify a transformation, AWS WAF performs the transformation on ``FieldToMatch`` before inspecting it for a match. You can only specify a single type of TextTransformation. *CMD_LINE* When you're concerned that attackers are injecting an operating system command line command and using unusual formatting to disguise some or all of the command, use this option to perform the following transformations: - Delete the following characters: \\ " ' ^ - Delete spaces before the following characters: / ( - Replace the following characters with a space: , ; - Replace multiple spaces with one space - Convert uppercase letters (A-Z) to lowercase (a-z) *COMPRESS_WHITE_SPACE* Use this option to replace the following characters with a space character (decimal 32): - \\f, formfeed, decimal 12 - \\t, tab, decimal 9 - \\n, newline, decimal 10 - \\r, carriage return, decimal 13 - \\v, vertical tab, decimal 11 - non-breaking space, decimal 160 ``COMPRESS_WHITE_SPACE`` also replaces multiple spaces with one space. *HTML_ENTITY_DECODE* Use this option to replace HTML-encoded characters with unencoded characters. ``HTML_ENTITY_DECODE`` performs the following operations: - Replaces ``(ampersand)quot;`` with ``"`` - Replaces ``(ampersand)nbsp;`` with a non-breaking space, decimal 160 - Replaces ``(ampersand)lt;`` with a "less than" symbol - Replaces ``(ampersand)gt;`` with ``>`` - Replaces characters that are represented in hexadecimal format, ``(ampersand)#xhhhh;`` , with the corresponding characters - Replaces characters that are represented in decimal format, ``(ampersand)#nnnn;`` , with the corresponding characters *LOWERCASE* Use this option to convert uppercase letters (A-Z) to lowercase (a-z). *URL_DECODE* Use this option to decode a URL-encoded value. *NONE* Specify ``NONE`` if you don't want to perform any text transformations.
            :param target_string: The value that you want AWS WAF to search for. AWS WAF searches for the specified string in the part of web requests that you specified in ``FieldToMatch`` . The maximum length of the value is 50 bytes. You must specify this property or the ``TargetStringBase64`` property. Valid values depend on the values that you specified for ``FieldToMatch`` : - ``HEADER`` : The value that you want AWS WAF to search for in the request header that you specified in ``FieldToMatch`` , for example, the value of the ``User-Agent`` or ``Referer`` header. - ``METHOD`` : The HTTP method, which indicates the type of operation specified in the request. - ``QUERY_STRING`` : The value that you want AWS WAF to search for in the query string, which is the part of a URL that appears after a ``?`` character. - ``URI`` : The value that you want AWS WAF to search for in the part of a URL that identifies a resource, for example, ``/images/daily-ad.jpg`` . - ``BODY`` : The part of a request that contains any additional data that you want to send to your web server as the HTTP request body, such as data from a form. The request body immediately follows the request headers. Note that only the first ``8192`` bytes of the request body are forwarded to AWS WAF for inspection. To allow or block requests based on the length of the body, you can create a size constraint set. - ``SINGLE_QUERY_ARG`` : The parameter in the query string that you will inspect, such as *UserName* or *SalesRegion* . The maximum length for ``SINGLE_QUERY_ARG`` is 30 characters. - ``ALL_QUERY_ARGS`` : Similar to ``SINGLE_QUERY_ARG`` , but instead of inspecting a single parameter, AWS WAF inspects all parameters within the query string for the value or regex pattern that you specify in ``TargetString`` . If ``TargetString`` includes alphabetic characters A-Z and a-z, note that the value is case sensitive.
            :param target_string_base64: The base64-encoded value that AWS WAF searches for. AWS CloudFormation sends this value to AWS WAF without encoding it. You must specify this property or the ``TargetString`` property. AWS WAF searches for this value in a specific part of web requests, which you define in the ``FieldToMatch`` property. Valid values depend on the Type value in the ``FieldToMatch`` property. For example, for a ``METHOD`` type, you must specify HTTP methods such as ``DELETE, GET, HEAD, OPTIONS, PATCH, POST`` , and ``PUT`` .

            You can only specify a single type of TextTransformation.

            *CMD_LINE*

            When you're concerned that attackers are injecting an operating system command line command and using unusual formatting to disguise some or all of the command, use this option to perform the following transformations:

            - Delete the following characters: \\ " ' ^
            - Delete spaces before the following characters: / (
            - Replace the following characters with a space: , ;
            - Replace multiple spaces with one space
            - Convert uppercase letters (A-Z) to lowercase (a-z)

            *COMPRESS_WHITE_SPACE*

            Use this option to replace the following characters with a space character (decimal 32):

            - \\f, formfeed, decimal 12
            - \\t, tab, decimal 9
            - \\n, newline, decimal 10
            - \\r, carriage return, decimal 13
            - \\v, vertical tab, decimal 11
            - non-breaking space, decimal 160

            ``COMPRESS_WHITE_SPACE`` also replaces multiple spaces with one space.

            *HTML_ENTITY_DECODE*

            Use this option to replace HTML-encoded characters with unencoded characters. ``HTML_ENTITY_DECODE`` performs the following operations:

            - Replaces ``(ampersand)quot;`` with ``"``
            - Replaces ``(ampersand)nbsp;`` with a non-breaking space, decimal 160
            - Replaces ``(ampersand)lt;`` with a "less than" symbol
            - Replaces ``(ampersand)gt;`` with ``>``
            - Replaces characters that are represented in hexadecimal format, ``(ampersand)#xhhhh;`` , with the corresponding characters
            - Replaces characters that are represented in decimal format, ``(ampersand)#nnnn;`` , with the corresponding characters

            *LOWERCASE*

            Use this option to convert uppercase letters (A-Z) to lowercase (a-z).

            *URL_DECODE*

            Use this option to decode a URL-encoded value.

            *NONE*

The request body immediately follows the request headers. Note that only the first ``8192`` bytes of the request body are forwarded to AWS WAF for inspection. To allow or block requests based on the length of the body, you can create a size constraint set.
            - ``SINGLE_QUERY_ARG`` : The parameter in the query string that you will inspect, such as *UserName* or *SalesRegion* . The maximum length for ``SINGLE_QUERY_ARG`` is 30 characters.
            - ``ALL_QUERY_ARGS`` : Similar to ``SINGLE_QUERY_ARG`` , but instead of inspecting a single parameter, AWS WAF inspects all parameters within the query string for the value or regex pattern that you specify in ``TargetString`` .

            If ``TargetString`` includes alphabetic characters A-Z and a-z, note that the value is case sensitive.

    Contains one or more IP addresses or blocks of IP addresses specified in Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR) notation. AWS WAF supports IPv4 address ranges: /8 and any range between /16 through /32. AWS WAF supports IPv6 address ranges: /24, /32, /48, /56, /64, and /128.

    To specify an individual IP address, you specify the four-part IP address followed by a ``/32`` , for example, 192.0.2.0/32. To block a range of IP addresses, you can specify /8 or any range between /16 through /32 (for IPv4) or /24, /32, /48, /56, /64, or /128 (for IPv6).

       This is *AWS WAF Classic* documentation. For more information, see `AWS WAF Classic <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/classic-waf-chapter.html>`_ in the developer guide.

       *For the latest version of AWS WAF* , use the AWS WAF V2 API and see the `AWS WAF Developer Guide <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/waf-chapter.html>`_ . With the latest version, AWS WAF has a single set of endpoints for regional and global use.

    A ``RateBasedRule`` is identical to a regular ``Rule`` , with one addition: a ``RateBasedRule`` counts the number of requests that arrive from a specified IP address every five minutes. For example, based on recent requests that you've seen from an attacker, you might create a ``RateBasedRule`` that includes the following conditions:

    - The requests come from 192.0.2.44.
    - They contain the value ``BadBot`` in the ``User-Agent`` header.

    In the rule, you also define the rate limit as 15,000.

    Requests that meet both of these conditions and exceed 15,000 requests every five minutes trigger the rule's action (block or count), which is defined in the web ACL.

    Note you can only create rate-based rules using an AWS CloudFormation template. To add the rate-based rules created through AWS CloudFormation to a web ACL, use the AWS WAF console, API, or command line interface (CLI). For more information, see `UpdateWebACL <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/APIReference/API_regional_UpdateWebACL.html>`_ .

       *For the latest version of AWS WAF* , use the AWS WAF V2 API and see the `AWS WAF Developer Guide <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/waf-chapter.html>`_ . With the latest version, AWS WAF has a single set of endpoints for regional and global use.

    A combination of ``ByteMatchSet`` , ``IPSet`` , and/or ``SqlInjectionMatchSet`` objects that identify the web requests that you want to allow, block, or count. For example, you might create a ``Rule`` that includes the following predicates:

    - An ``IPSet`` that causes AWS WAF to search for web requests that originate from the IP address ``192.0.2.44``
    - A ``ByteMatchSet`` that causes AWS WAF to search for web requests for which the value of the ``User-Agent`` header is ``BadBot`` .

    To match the settings in this ``Rule`` , a request must originate from ``192.0.2.44`` AND include a ``User-Agent`` header for which the value is ``BadBot`` .

               *For the latest version of AWS WAF* , use the AWS WAF V2 API and see the `AWS WAF Developer Guide <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/waf-chapter.html>`_ . With the latest version, AWS WAF has a single set of endpoints for regional and global use.

            Specifies a constraint on the size of a part of the web request. AWS WAF uses the ``Size`` , ``ComparisonOperator`` , and ``FieldToMatch`` to build an expression in the form of " ``Size`` ``ComparisonOperator`` size in bytes of ``FieldToMatch`` ". If that expression is true, the ``SizeConstraint`` is considered to match.

            :param comparison_operator: The type of comparison you want AWS WAF to perform. AWS WAF uses this in combination with the provided ``Size`` and ``FieldToMatch`` to build an expression in the form of " ``Size`` ``ComparisonOperator`` size in bytes of ``FieldToMatch`` ". If that expression is true, the ``SizeConstraint`` is considered to match. *EQ* : Used to test if the ``Size`` is equal to the size of the ``FieldToMatch`` *NE* : Used to test if the ``Size`` is not equal to the size of the ``FieldToMatch`` *LE* : Used to test if the ``Size`` is less than or equal to the size of the ``FieldToMatch`` *LT* : Used to test if the ``Size`` is strictly less than the size of the ``FieldToMatch`` *GE* : Used to test if the ``Size`` is greater than or equal to the size of the ``FieldToMatch`` *GT* : Used to test if the ``Size`` is strictly greater than the size of the ``FieldToMatch``
            :param field_to_match: The part of a web request that you want AWS WAF to inspect, such as a specific header or a query string.
            :param size: The size in bytes that you want AWS WAF to compare against the size of the specified ``FieldToMatch`` . AWS WAF uses this in combination with ``ComparisonOperator`` and ``FieldToMatch`` to build an expression in the form of " ``Size`` ``ComparisonOperator`` size in bytes of ``FieldToMatch`` ". If that expression is true, the ``SizeConstraint`` is considered to match. Valid values for size are 0 - 21474836480 bytes (0 - 20 GB). If you specify ``URI`` for the value of ``Type`` , the / in the URI path that you specify counts as one character. For example, the URI ``/logo.jpg`` is nine characters long.
            :param text_transformation: Text transformations eliminate some of the unusual formatting that attackers use in web requests in an effort to bypass AWS WAF . If you specify a transformation, AWS WAF performs the transformation on ``FieldToMatch`` before inspecting a request for a match. You can only specify a single type of TextTransformation. Note that if you choose ``BODY`` for the value of ``Type`` , you must choose ``NONE`` for ``TextTransformation`` because the API Gateway API or Application Load Balancer forward only the first 8192 bytes for inspection. *NONE* Specify ``NONE`` if you don't want to perform any text transformations. *CMD_LINE* When you're concerned that attackers are injecting an operating system command line command and using unusual formatting to disguise some or all of the command, use this option to perform the following transformations: - Delete the following characters: \\ " ' ^ - Delete spaces before the following characters: / ( - Replace the following characters with a space: , ; - Replace multiple spaces with one space - Convert uppercase letters (A-Z) to lowercase (a-z) *COMPRESS_WHITE_SPACE* Use this option to replace the following characters with a space character (decimal 32): - \\f, formfeed, decimal 12 - \\t, tab, decimal 9 - \\n, newline, decimal 10 - \\r, carriage return, decimal 13 - \\v, vertical tab, decimal 11 - non-breaking space, decimal 160 ``COMPRESS_WHITE_SPACE`` also replaces multiple spaces with one space. *HTML_ENTITY_DECODE* Use this option to replace HTML-encoded characters with unencoded characters. ``HTML_ENTITY_DECODE`` performs the following operations: - Replaces ``(ampersand)quot;`` with ``"`` - Replaces ``(ampersand)nbsp;`` with a non-breaking space, decimal 160 - Replaces ``(ampersand)lt;`` with a "less than" symbol - Replaces ``(ampersand)gt;`` with ``>`` - Replaces characters that are represented in hexadecimal format, ``(ampersand)#xhhhh;`` , with the corresponding characters - Replaces characters that are represented in decimal format, ``(ampersand)#nnnn;`` , with the corresponding characters *LOWERCASE* Use this option to convert uppercase letters (A-Z) to lowercase (a-z). *URL_DECODE* Use this option to decode a URL-encoded value.

            *CMD_LINE*

            When you're concerned that attackers are injecting an operating system command line command and using unusual formatting to disguise some or all of the command, use this option to perform the following transformations:

            - Delete the following characters: \\ " ' ^
            - Delete spaces before the following characters: / (
            - Replace the following characters with a space: , ;
            - Replace multiple spaces with one space
            - Convert uppercase letters (A-Z) to lowercase (a-z)

            *COMPRESS_WHITE_SPACE*

            Use this option to replace the following characters with a space character (decimal 32):

            - \\f, formfeed, decimal 12
            - \\t, tab, decimal 9
            - \\n, newline, decimal 10
            - \\r, carriage return, decimal 13
            - \\v, vertical tab, decimal 11
            - non-breaking space, decimal 160

            ``COMPRESS_WHITE_SPACE`` also replaces multiple spaces with one space.

            *HTML_ENTITY_DECODE*

            Use this option to replace HTML-encoded characters with unencoded characters. ``HTML_ENTITY_DECODE`` performs the following operations:

            - Replaces ``(ampersand)quot;`` with ``"``
            - Replaces ``(ampersand)nbsp;`` with a non-breaking space, decimal 160
            - Replaces ``(ampersand)lt;`` with a "less than" symbol
            - Replaces ``(ampersand)gt;`` with ``>``
            - Replaces characters that are represented in hexadecimal format, ``(ampersand)#xhhhh;`` , with the corresponding characters
            - Replaces characters that are represented in decimal format, ``(ampersand)#nnnn;`` , with the corresponding characters

            *LOWERCASE*

            Use this option to convert uppercase letters (A-Z) to lowercase (a-z).

            *URL_DECODE*

            Use this option to decode a URL-encoded value.

            *NONE*

            Specify ``NONE`` if you don't want to perform any text transformations.

       This is *AWS WAF Classic* documentation. For more information, see `AWS WAF Classic <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/classic-waf-chapter.html>`_ in the developer guide.

       *For the latest version of AWS WAF* , use the AWS WAF V2 API and see the `AWS WAF Developer Guide <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/waf-chapter.html>`_ . With the latest version, AWS WAF has a single set of endpoints for regional and global use.

    Contains the ``Rules`` that identify the requests that you want to allow, block, or count. In a ``WebACL`` , you also specify a default action ( ``ALLOW`` or ``BLOCK`` ), and the action for each ``Rule`` that you add to a ``WebACL`` , for example, block requests from specified IP addresses or block requests from specified referrers. If you add more than one ``Rule`` to a ``WebACL`` , a request needs to match only one of the specifications to be allowed, blocked, or counted.

    To identify the requests that you want AWS WAF to filter, you associate the ``WebACL`` with an API Gateway API or an Application Load Balancer.

    A complex type that contains ``XssMatchTuple`` objects, which specify the parts of web requests that you want AWS WAF to inspect for cross-site scripting attacks and, if you want AWS WAF to inspect a header, the name of the header. If a ``XssMatchSet`` contains more than one ``XssMatchTuple`` object, a request needs to include cross-site scripting attacks in only one of the specified parts of the request to be considered a match.

            - ``METHOD`` : The HTTP method, which indicates the type of operation that the request is asking the origin to perform.
            - ``QUERY_STRING`` : A query string, which is the part of a URL that appears after a ``?`` character, if any.
            - ``URI`` : The part of a web request that identifies a resource, for example, ``/images/daily-ad.jpg`` .
            - ``BODY`` : The part of a request that contains any additional data that you want to send to your web server as the HTTP request body, such as data from a form. The request body immediately follows the request headers. Note that only the first ``8192`` bytes of the request body are forwarded to AWS WAF for inspection. To allow or block requests based on the length of the body, you can create a size constraint set.
            - ``SINGLE_QUERY_ARG`` : The parameter in the query string that you will inspect, such as *UserName* or *SalesRegion* . The maximum length for ``SINGLE_QUERY_ARG`` is 30 characters.
            - ``ALL_QUERY_ARGS`` : Similar to ``SINGLE_QUERY_ARG`` , but rather than inspecting a single parameter, AWS WAF will inspect all parameters within the query for the value or regex pattern that you specify in ``TargetString`` .

            *CMD_LINE*

            When you're concerned that attackers are injecting an operating system command line command and using unusual formatting to disguise some or all of the command, use this option to perform the following transformations:

            - Delete the following characters: \\ " ' ^
            - Delete spaces before the following characters: / (
            - Replace the following characters with a space: , ;
            - Replace multiple spaces with one space
            - Convert uppercase letters (A-Z) to lowercase (a-z)

            *COMPRESS_WHITE_SPACE*

            Use this option to replace the following characters with a space character (decimal 32):

            - \\f, formfeed, decimal 12
            - \\t, tab, decimal 9
            - \\n, newline, decimal 10
            - \\r, carriage return, decimal 13
            - \\v, vertical tab, decimal 11
            - non-breaking space, decimal 160

            ``COMPRESS_WHITE_SPACE`` also replaces multiple spaces with one space.

            *HTML_ENTITY_DECODE*

            Use this option to replace HTML-encoded characters with unencoded characters. ``HTML_ENTITY_DECODE`` performs the following operations:

            - Replaces ``(ampersand)quot;`` with ``"``
            - Replaces ``(ampersand)nbsp;`` with a non-breaking space, decimal 160
            - Replaces ``(ampersand)lt;`` with a "less than" symbol
            - Replaces ``(ampersand)gt;`` with ``>``
            - Replaces characters that are represented in hexadecimal format, ``(ampersand)#xhhhh;`` , with the corresponding characters
            - Replaces characters that are represented in decimal format, ``(ampersand)#nnnn;`` , with the corresponding characters

            *LOWERCASE*

            Use this option to convert uppercase letters (A-Z) to lowercase (a-z).

            *URL_DECODE*

            Use this option to decode a URL-encoded value.

            *NONE*

            Specify ``NONE`` if you don't want to perform any text transformations.
