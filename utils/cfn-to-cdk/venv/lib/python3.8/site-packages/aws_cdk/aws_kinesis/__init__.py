# Amazon Kinesis Construct Library

[Amazon Kinesis](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/streams/latest/dev/introduction.html) provides collection and processing of large
[streams](https://aws.amazon.com/streaming-data/) of data records in real time. Kinesis data streams can be used for rapid and continuous data
intake and aggregation.

## Streams

Amazon Kinesis Data Streams ingests a large amount of data in real time, durably stores the data, and makes the data available for consumption.

Using the CDK, a new Kinesis stream can be created as part of the stack using the construct's constructor. You may specify the `streamName` to give
your own identifier to the stream. If not, CloudFormation will generate a name.

```python
kinesis.Stream(self, "MyFirstStream",
    stream_name="my-awesome-stream"
)
```

You can also specify properties such as `shardCount` to indicate how many shards the stream should choose and a `retentionPeriod`
to specify how long the data in the shards should remain accessible.
Read more at [Creating and Managing Streams](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/streams/latest/dev/working-with-streams.html)

```python
kinesis.Stream(self, "MyFirstStream",
    stream_name="my-awesome-stream",
    shard_count=3,
    retention_period=Duration.hours(48)
)
```

### Encryption

[Stream encryption](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-properties-kinesis-stream-streamencryption.html) enables
server-side encryption using an AWS KMS key for a specified stream.

Encryption is enabled by default on your stream with the master key owned by Kinesis Data Streams in regions where it is supported.

```python
kinesis.Stream(self, "MyEncryptedStream")
```

You can enable encryption on your stream with a user-managed key by specifying the `encryption` property.
A KMS key will be created for you and associated with the stream.

```python
kinesis.Stream(self, "MyEncryptedStream",
    encryption=kinesis.StreamEncryption.KMS
)
```

You can also supply your own external KMS key to use for stream encryption by specifying the `encryptionKey` property.

```python
key = kms.Key(self, "MyKey")

kinesis.Stream(self, "MyEncryptedStream",
    encryption=kinesis.StreamEncryption.KMS,
    encryption_key=key
)
```

### Import

Any Kinesis stream that has been created outside the stack can be imported into your CDK app.

Streams can be imported by their ARN via the `Stream.fromStreamArn()` API

```python
imported_stream = kinesis.Stream.from_stream_arn(self, "ImportedStream", "arn:aws:kinesis:us-east-2:123456789012:stream/f3j09j2230j")
```

Encrypted Streams can also be imported by their attributes via the `Stream.fromStreamAttributes()` API

```python
imported_stream = kinesis.Stream.from_stream_attributes(self, "ImportedEncryptedStream",
    stream_arn="arn:aws:kinesis:us-east-2:123456789012:stream/f3j09j2230j",
    encryption_key=kms.Key.from_key_arn(self, "key", "arn:aws:kms:us-east-1:123456789012:key/12345678-1234-1234-1234-123456789012")
)
```

### Permission Grants

IAM roles, users or groups which need to be able to work with Amazon Kinesis streams at runtime should be granted IAM permissions.

Any object that implements the `IGrantable` interface (has an associated principal) can be granted permissions by calling:

* `grantRead(principal)` - grants the principal read access
* `grantWrite(principal)` - grants the principal write permissions to a Stream
* `grantReadWrite(principal)` - grants principal read and write permissions

#### Read Permissions

Grant `read` access to a stream by calling the `grantRead()` API.
If the stream has an encryption key, read permissions will also be granted to the key.

```python
lambda_role = iam.Role(self, "Role",
    assumed_by=iam.ServicePrincipal("lambda.amazonaws.com"),
    description="Example role..."
)

stream = kinesis.Stream(self, "MyEncryptedStream",
    encryption=kinesis.StreamEncryption.KMS
)

# give lambda permissions to read stream
stream.grant_read(lambda_role)
```

The following read permissions are provided to a service principal by the `grantRead()` API:

* `kinesis:DescribeStreamSummary`
* `kinesis:GetRecords`
* `kinesis:GetShardIterator`
* `kinesis:ListShards`
* `kinesis:SubscribeToShard`

#### Write Permissions

Grant `write` permissions to a stream is provided by calling the `grantWrite()` API.
If the stream has an encryption key, write permissions will also be granted to the key.

```python
lambda_role = iam.Role(self, "Role",
    assumed_by=iam.ServicePrincipal("lambda.amazonaws.com"),
    description="Example role..."
)

stream = kinesis.Stream(self, "MyEncryptedStream",
    encryption=kinesis.StreamEncryption.KMS
)

# give lambda permissions to write to stream
stream.grant_write(lambda_role)
```

The following write permissions are provided to a service principal by the `grantWrite()` API:

* `kinesis:ListShards`
* `kinesis:PutRecord`
* `kinesis:PutRecords`

#### Custom Permissions

You can add any set of permissions to a stream by calling the `grant()` API.

```python
user = iam.User(self, "MyUser")

stream = kinesis.Stream(self, "MyStream")

# give my user permissions to list shards
stream.grant(user, "kinesis:ListShards")
```

### Metrics

You can use common metrics from your stream to create alarms and/or dashboards. The `stream.metric('MetricName')` method creates a metric with the stream namespace and dimension. You can also use pre-define methods like `stream.metricGetRecordsSuccess()`. To find out more about Kinesis metrics check [Monitoring the Amazon Kinesis Data Streams Service with Amazon CloudWatch](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/streams/latest/dev/monitoring-with-cloudwatch.html).

```python
stream = kinesis.Stream(self, "MyStream")

# Using base metric method passing the metric name
stream.metric("GetRecords.Success")

# using pre-defined metric method
stream.metric_get_records_success()

# using pre-defined and overriding the statistic
stream.metric_get_records_success(statistic="Maximum")
```

    Use the AWS CloudFormation ``AWS::Kinesis::StreamConsumer`` resource to register a consumer with a Kinesis data stream. The consumer you register can then call `SubscribeToShard <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kinesis/latest/APIReference/API_SubscribeToShard.html>`_ to receive data from the stream using enhanced fan-out, at a rate of up to 2 MiB per second for every shard you subscribe to. This rate is unaffected by the total number of consumers that read from the same stream.

    You can register up to five consumers per stream. However, you can request a limit increase using the `Kinesis Data Streams limits form <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/support/v1?#/>`_ . A given consumer can only be registered with one stream at a time.
