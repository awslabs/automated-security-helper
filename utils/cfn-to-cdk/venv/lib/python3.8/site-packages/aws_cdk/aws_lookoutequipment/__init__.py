# AWS::LookoutEquipment Construct Library

This module is part of the [AWS Cloud Development Kit](https://github.com/aws/aws-cdk) project.

```python
import aws_cdk.aws_lookoutequipment as lookoutequipment
```

> The construct library for this service is in preview. Since it is not stable yet, it is distributed
> as a separate package so that you can pin its version independently of the rest of the CDK. See the package:

> <span class="package-reference">@aws-cdk/aws-lookoutequipment-alpha</span>

<!--BEGIN CFNONLY DISCLAIMER-->

There are no hand-written ([L2](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/latest/guide/constructs.html#constructs_lib)) constructs for this service yet.
However, you can still use the automatically generated [L1](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/latest/guide/constructs.html#constructs_l1_using) constructs, and use this service exactly as you would using CloudFormation directly.

For more information on the resources and properties available for this service, see the [CloudFormation documentation for AWS::LookoutEquipment](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/AWS_LookoutEquipment.html).

(Read the [CDK Contributing Guide](https://github.com/aws/aws-cdk/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) if you are interested in contributing to this construct library.)

    '''A CloudFormation ``AWS::LookoutEquipment::InferenceScheduler``.

    Creates a scheduled inference. Scheduling an inference is setting up a continuous real-time inference plan to analyze new measurement data. When setting up the schedule, you provide an Amazon S3 bucket location for the input data, assign it a delimiter between separate entries in the data, set an offset delay if desired, and set the frequency of inferencing. You must also provide an Amazon S3 bucket location for the output data.
    .. epigraph::

       Updating some properties below (for example, InferenceSchedulerName and ServerSideKmsKeyId) triggers a resource replacement, which requires a new model. To replace such a property using AWS CloudFormation , but without creating a completely new stack, you must replace ModelName. If you need to replace the property, but want to use the same model, delete the current stack and create a new one with the updated properties.

For instance, if you select 5 minutes, Amazon Lookout for Equipment will upload the real-time data to the source bucket once every 5 minutes. This frequency also determines how often Amazon Lookout for Equipment starts a scheduled inference on your data. In this example, it starts once every 5 minutes.

For example, if five minutes is selected, the inference scheduler will wake up at the configured frequency with the additional five minute delay time to check the customer S3 bucket. The customer can upload data at the same frequency and they don't need to stop and restart the scheduler when uploading new data.
