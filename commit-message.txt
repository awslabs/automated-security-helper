refine: Prioritize jq as preferred tool in GenAI guide

Apply Kiro's feedback to emphasize jq as the preferred tool for JSON
parsing while maintaining fallbacks for compatibility.

Key Changes:

Tool Priority Clarification:
- Added "Default Tool Priority" section at top of Quick Reference
- Explicitly state: jq (ALWAYS TRY FIRST) > Python > grep/awk
- Changed "Optional but recommended" to "Preferred" for jq
- Added command to check jq availability upfront

Section Reorganization:
- Renamed "Strategy 1" to "Using jq (PREFERRED)"
- Renamed "Strategy 2" to "Using Python (FALLBACK)"
- Renamed "Strategy 3" to "Using grep (LAST RESORT)"
- Renumbered remaining strategies (Streaming, Simpler Formats)

Language Updates Throughout:
- "With jq (if available)" → "Recommended: Using jq"
- "Without jq" → "Fallback: Using Python"
- "Without jq or Python" → "Last Resort: Using grep/awk"
- Added "(preferred method)" annotations to jq examples
- Emphasized "ALWAYS TRY FIRST" for jq

Code Improvements:
- Better exception handling (Exception instead of bare except)
- Fixed grep parsing bug (added strip() before split)
- Reordered imports (subprocess before shutil)
- Added clearer comments about tool preference

Rationale:
- jq is significantly faster and more efficient than Python
- Most Linux/macOS systems have jq installed
- GenAI tools should attempt the most efficient method first
- Fallbacks ensure compatibility across all environments

This maintains the practical approach while optimizing for performance
when jq is available.
